[Tasklist](https://hayyan-tasklist.netlify.app) is a simple and user-friendly task management app designed to help you organize and manage your daily tasks effectively.

## Features

1. **Textarea-Based Todo Creation**:  
   Each new line in the textarea creates a separate task automatically.

2. **Separate Lists for Completed and Incomplete Tasks**:  
   Tasks are categorized into "Completed" and "Incomplete" lists for better organization.

3. **Dynamic List Shifting**:  
   - When a task is marked as complete, it automatically moves from the incomplete list to the completed list.  
   - Similarly, tasks can be moved back to the incomplete list from the completed list.

4. **Session Storage Integration**:  
   The app uses session storage to ensure your tasks are preserved even after refreshing the page.

5. **Total Tasks Count**:  
   Displays the total number of tasks.

   Shows the number of incomplete tasks left to be done.
